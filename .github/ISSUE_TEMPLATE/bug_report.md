## Current behavior

When I go to my workspace settings and try to import issues from Github, it locks on the "processing" step. It's been 6 hours now since I started the import but it is still processing.

## Expected behavior

Should import issues without waiting on "processing" step.

## Is there an existing ticket?

Yes - [ticket link](https://fundwave.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/)

2. Go to the workspace settings
3. Link a Github organization on the Integration section
